Welcome to AmazingITorg - a fictional IT organization, whose goal is to find the key to `Amazingness`.

After receiving some finctional funding, the company decided to start working on it's ultimate goal. Nowadays the company consists of two dedicated teams of IT proffesionals, that try to deliver the best possible solution to `Amazingness`. One team is developing a [full-stack 'Amazing-People'](https://github.com/AmazingITorg/amazing-people) solution, that can show all the amazing people in the world and gives the option for every user to try and add a person that's amazing. If the person is not amazing though - the entry won't get added. The other team is working on [the ultimate `Amazingness` algorithm](https://github.com/AmazingITorg/amazingness-service), that's being used by the first team's application. A very fancy and complicated solution that is still being worked on and is improved with every release. It is a java application that serves the amazingness-service solution through a REST API.
